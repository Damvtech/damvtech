# 👋 David Moreno Vituri - Data Analyst & BI Developer

🎯 **The bridge between business and data**
I come from the world of digital marketing — campaign budgets, KPIs, and business goals. But today, I speak the language of data: Python, SQL, Power BI, and machine learning.  

What sets me apart? I don't just build dashboards — I know *why* they're needed, *who* needs them, and *how* they'll drive results.  
I’m a Data Analyst with a business mindset, helping teams turn noise into clarity and decisions into impact.
